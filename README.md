Frontend Mentor | News homepage challenge, using css js(jQuery) and html(bootstrap)
What I learned:
- how to create hamburger manually without using bootstrap, since the regular bootstrap hamburger drop down isnt a side bar.
(made it kinda complicated, involved using alot of classes. maybe i could make it with less code in the future)
- nesting bootstrap grids to create a responsive website.
- using bootstrap cards to create mini table sections

what i reviewed:
- using float to float images to the side
- aspect ratio for images
- css overflow:hidden to change scrolling functions after opening hamburg.
